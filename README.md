## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **State-wise Sales Comparison:** Analyze the sum of sales amounts across different states.
2. **Top Spender Analysis:** Identify the individual who has spent the most on purchases.
3. **Product Category Analysis:** Determine which product category (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture) is ordered the most.
4. **Payment Mode Analysis:** Evaluate the most commonly used payment methods.
5. **Monthly Profit Analysis:** Assess which months generate the highest and lowest profits.
6. **Sub-Category Performance:** Identify which product sub-categories contribute the most to profits.

## Process

1. **Dashboard Creation:** Developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to track and analyze online sales data.
2. **Data Manipulation:** Implemented complex parameters, joined new tables, and performed calculations to enhance data visualization and user interaction.
